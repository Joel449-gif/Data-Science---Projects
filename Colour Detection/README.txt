About the project:
    
    In this colour detection python project, I have build an application through 
which we can autimatically get the name of the colour by clicking on them. So for
this I have a data file that contains the colour name and its values. Then I have
calculated the distance from each color and find the shortest one.

Prerequisites:
    - OpenCV
    - Pandas

Packages required:
    OpenCV, Pandas and numpy
    To install them,
        pip install opencv-python numpy pandas

This project contains 3 files:
    -> color_detection.py - main source code
    -> Colorpic.jpg - sample image for experimenting
    -> Colors.csv - dataset
