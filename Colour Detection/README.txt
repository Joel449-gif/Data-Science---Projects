ABOUT THE PROJECT:
    
    In this colour detection python project, I have build an application through 
which we can autimatically get the name of the colour by clicking on them. So for
this I have a data file that contains the colour name and its values. Then I have
calculated the distance from each color and find the shortest one.

PREREQUISITES:
    - OpenCV
    - Pandas

PACKAGES REQUIRED:
    OpenCV, Pandas and numpy
    To install them,
        pip install opencv-python numpy pandas

THIS PROJECT CONTAINS 3 FILE:
    -> color_detection.py - main source code
    -> ColorScene.jpg - sample image for experimenting
    -> Colors.csv - dataset

FOR OUTPUT:
Write this code in command prompt : python color_detection.py -i <add your image path here>
Double click on the window to know the name of the pixel color.
